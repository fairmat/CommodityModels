Schwartz & Smith Model 
============

This is a port from the code of Moeti Ncube published here: http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/29751-calibration-method-for-the-schwartz-smith-model to C#, currently it's not yet a plugin for Fairmat but a direct conversion of the original code, showing the use of the Fairmat Math API to port code easily.

The port is under LGPL, like the rest of the code in these repositories, while the original code is under this BSD license:
